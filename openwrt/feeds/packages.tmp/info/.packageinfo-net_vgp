Title: A daemon working like Cisco(c) HSRP
Maintainer: OpenWrt Developers Team <openwrt-devel@openwrt.org>
Type: ipkg
Description: 	VGP (Virtual Gateway Protocol)is a very simple protocol able to 
	work in a way similar to Cisco(c) HSRP. It implements the idea 
	of Virtual Gateway to provide fault tollerance (and load 
	balancing) on your net. Each client on your net has as its 
	default gateway set to the virtual gateway and not the real router.
