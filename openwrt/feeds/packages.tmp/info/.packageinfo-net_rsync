Title: Fast remote file copy program (like rcp)
Maintainer: OpenWrt Developers Team <openwrt-devel@openwrt.org>
Type: ipkg
Description: 	sync is a program that allows files to be copied to
	and from remote machines in much the same way as rcp.
	It has many more options than rcp, and uses the rsync
	remote-update protocol to greatly speed up file
	transfers when the destination file already exists.

	The rsync remote-update protocol allows rsync to
	transfer just the differences between two sets of files
	across the network link.
