Description:  wxBase contains most of the non-GUI classes from the wxWindows cross-
 -platform C++ framework. There are 2 categories: generally useful portable 
 code (date/time handling, command line parsing, regular expression support) 
 and wrappers for the OS objects (files, directories, sockets, threads, 
 etc.) allowing you to write portable programs easily.
