Description: Pango is a library for layout and rendering of text, with an emphasis
on internationalization. Pango can be used anywhere that text layout
is needed; however, most of the work on Pango so far has been done using
the GTK+ widget toolkit as a test platform. Pango forms the core of text
and font handling for GTK+-2.x.
