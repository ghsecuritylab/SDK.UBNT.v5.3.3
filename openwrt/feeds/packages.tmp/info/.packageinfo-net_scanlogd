Title: Port scan detection tool
Maintainer: OpenWrt Developers Team <openwrt-devel@openwrt.org>
Type: ipkg
Description: 	Scanlogd is a TCP port scan detection tool, originally designed 
	to illustrate various attacks an IDS developer has to deal with.
	Thus, unlike some of the other port scan detection tools out there, 
	scanlogd is designed to be totally safe to use.
