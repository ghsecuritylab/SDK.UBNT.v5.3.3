Description:  PTLib is a moderately large class library that has its genesis many years ago as
 PWLib (portable Windows Library), a method to product applications to run on both
 Microsoft Windows and Unix X-Windows systems. It also was to have a Macintosh port
 as well but that never eventuated. The parts of the library relating to GUI
 functions have long been removed as other class libraries such as wxWidgets were
 much more advanced.
