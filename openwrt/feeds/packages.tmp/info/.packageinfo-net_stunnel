Type: ipkg
Description: 	Stunnel is a program that allows you to encrypt arbitrary TCP
	connections inside SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) available on both Unix
	and Windows. Stunnel can allow you to secure non-SSL aware daemons and
	protocols (like POP, IMAP, LDAP, etc) by having Stunnel provide the
	encryption, requiring no changes to the daemon's code.
