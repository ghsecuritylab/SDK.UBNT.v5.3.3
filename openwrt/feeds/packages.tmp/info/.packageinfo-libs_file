Title: Determines file type using magic numbers
Maintainer: OpenWrt Developers Team <openwrt-devel@openwrt.org>
Type: ipkg
Description:  File tests each argument in an attempt to classify it. There
 are three sets of tests, performed in this order: filesystem
 tests, magic number tests, and language tests. The first test
 that succeeds causes the file type to be printed.

 Starting with version 4, the file command is not much more than
 a wrapper around the "magic" library.
