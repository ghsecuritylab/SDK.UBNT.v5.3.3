Title: A caching web proxy
Maintainer: OpenWrt Developers Team <openwrt-devel@openwrt.org>
Type: ipkg
Description:  Polipo is a small and fast caching web proxy (a web cache, an HTTP proxy, 
 a proxy server). While Polipo was designed to be used by one person or a 
 small group of people, there is nothing that prevents it from being used 
 by a larger group.
